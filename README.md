**Abstract**:
Deep learning has become the state-of-the-art in tasks regarding multi-dimensional data, such as image classification, thanks to its capacity to learn how to extract features from such data. As deep learning models try to mimic the behavior of the human brain with the use of deep artificial neural networks, to understand how good they are at achieving this task, we need to compare their reasoning in the decision-making process with that of a human. In specific, in the context of image classification, there is a need to evaluate how objects contained in images are used by these models to achieve a decision. To accomplish this purpose, first, we perform baseline experiments to study how classification networks may implicitly use objects contained in images to achieve a prediction, using a gradient-based method of interpretability to verify which parts of an image contribute the most to the prediction. Then, we explicitly provide the type of objects contained in the images to the classifier to evaluate whether providing this information improves its performance. In this last experiment, we use an object detection method to extract information about the objects contained in the images. With this approach, we arrived at the conclusions that normal image classification networks implicitly use objects contained in images in their predictions and that their performance can be improved by explicitly providing information about the objects, from which we can infer that there is still room for improvement in the feature extraction process done by a basic classification network.
